\f0\fs24 \cf0 This group of scripts pairs with the CaptureOne software, and is meant to be utilized on a Mac machine. A Python script within (python_folder_action.py) will open CaptureOne software and deploy the AutoScriptC1.scpt on a cossession.db file within a moved folder. The Applescript will then process images within that session following recipes within CaptureOne, close once finished, and move the folder containing the cosession.db file into its designated complete folder. This group of scripts essentially processes images on a designated machine without input from the user, making this process I have created at Iron Mountain, almost entirely eyes and hands-off. I would show it in action, but sharing assets is a breach of company policy. It is an early creation of mine, but extremely effective.}
